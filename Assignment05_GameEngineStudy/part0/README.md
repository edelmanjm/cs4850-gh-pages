For this portion of the assignment, you are going to review some source code to understand the structure of a game engine. 

**You will be modifying this README.md with your answeres (Search for TODO)**

## Horde3D Graphics Engine

Horde3D is a small and simple graphics engine. It was designed primarily to be integrated with other game engines and frameworks. Some features of the Horde3D engine are:

- It is a small graphics engine that supposedly has a relatively clean API.
- It is cross platform and uses the OpenGL API.
- It specializes in crowd simulation
