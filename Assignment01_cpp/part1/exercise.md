Debugging

Edit the following lines to list two things you learned about debugging (a command, a technique, a concept. etc.). This is a "for-credit" exercise, I will not evaluate what I consider "difficult enough", I just want to know you learned or practiced two things about debugging.

1. `Ctrl + X` can be pressed repeatedly to get different views in GDB  .
2. I didn't know about capturing replays in GDB, and I certainly didn't know you *step backwards* in replays. Super 
   cool.
