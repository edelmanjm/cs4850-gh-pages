<h1 id="ataris-asteroids-in-the-rose-engine">Atari&#39;s <em>Asteroids</em> in the ROSE engine</h1>

<p>
    For my final project, I completed a basic implementation of the classic 1979 Atari game <em>Asteroids</em> in my
    custom engine ROSE. ROSE builds on the entity-component model we&#39;ve been developing throughout this course.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Asteroids</em> provides an interesting challenge in that the original game is implemented using vector graphics
    on a vector display. Such hardware is no longer commonplace; however, modern high-resolution displays and
    advances in computation power allow us to rasterize vector graphics in realtime with ease. As such, I decided to
    tackle the challenge of handling vector graphics for my &quot;wow&quot; factor.
</p>
<p>
    To do this, I decided to rely on the extant SVG standard. I created a simple browser-based SVG editor tool that
    allowed me to trace screenshots of the original game art, while making basic adjustments to the lines. I then
    added support for basic SVG manipulation using Python&#39;s XML document parsing to transform the source SVG
    according to the movement of the player. Finally, I modified SDL_Image&#39;s SVG rendering code (which itself
    relies on nanosvg) to handle scaling properly when interfacing with Python. This provides me with
    infinitely-scalable graphics (which you can adjust through the <code>scaling</code> parameter of <code>config
    .json</code>).

<h2 id="post-mortem">Post-Mortem</h2>

<p>
    While I'm proud of what I accomplished, there were some significant cutbacks that had to be made to the scope of
    the game to get it done on time. Given additional time, here's what I'd work on, in order:
</p>

<ol type="1">
    <li>
        I'd like to improve the boundary between <code>h2d::Homogr</code> and SDL's AABB-based approach. For the
        purposes of this game, I needed to calculate the intersections between the character and other entities,
        even though the character isn't always axis-aligned. This necessitated the introduction of a more complex
        2D geometry library. I opted for h2d, which has been pretty good so far. However, converting between
        homographic transforms and the AABBs that SDL requires for rendering purposes has been painful. There's a
        lot of poorly-written, slower-than-necessary conversions scattered around the C++ side that were
        necessary to use many of SDL's functions. Given more time, I'd probably ditch most of SDL's non-core
        functionality and only rely on it for rendering (maybe even just for primitive drawing, while writing my
        own SVG renderer? IDK.) While I understand the performance advantages that SDL gets with its AABB-only
        approach, it just results in too many issues for a game that requires this much rotation.
    </li>
    <li>
        On the subject of boxes, I'd like to have perfect subpixel convex-hull based collisions. This is totally
        feasible using h2d, but I simply didn't implement it due to the significant increase in
        complexity—especially given how much SDL-based stuff is still in there.
    </li>
    <li>
        I'd clean up the Python game logic. While it's totally functional and extensible, it's messy enough that
        it's annoying to do so and difficult to read. There's no reason that needs to be the case, beyond that I
        didn't have time to clean it up.
    </li>
    <li>
        I'd add temporary invincibility after death. While I have implemented an asteroid "keep out" area for the
        initial spawn, respawning can still result in insta-death. That's not ideal.
    </li>
    <li>
        I'd add enemy ships, like the original game has. It adds a lot of gameplay depth, but I didn't have time
        to add them.
    </li>
    <li>
        I'd add the game's iconic audio and explosion FX.
    </li>
    <li>
        I'd add additional configurable game modes based on the various sequels to <em>Asteroids</em>, namely
        <em>Asteroids Deluxe</em> and <em>Space Duel</em>. The latter in particular is substantially more
        complex, but still retains the key gameplay loop and vector graphics of the original.
    </li>
</ol>
