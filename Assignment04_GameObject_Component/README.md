# Your Information

*TODO*: Please edit the following information in your assignment

* Name: Jonathan Edelman
* How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? Maybe 2
* Did you collaborate or share ideas with any other students/TAs/Professors? No 
* Did you use any external resources?
  * Only the Unity documentation for ideas about possible components.
* (Optional) What was the most interesting part of the assignment? How would you improve this assignment?
  * I really don't like using dynamic casts unless strictly necessary, so I opted to retain the m_Sprite field for 
    now (however temporarily that ends up being.) I'd like to see an alternative method that doesn't rely on dynamic 
    casts.

* Core is the material everyone can get through. I expect everyone to complete this. Coming to class, listening to lectures, and reviewing materials should be sufficient.
* Intermediate is a little more difficult. Very likely you will have to utilize office hours, piazza, etc.
* Advanced is more challenging. You will have to spend more time and very likely use outside materials. I do not expect everyone to complete the advanced section.
