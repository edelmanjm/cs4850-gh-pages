- List the components that you think are associated with some of the game objects you see in the following screenshot.
- You should be able to identify **at least 3** individual 'components' that make up the 'game objects' shown.
  - Remember that components are things that could be added to GameObjects, such that they can change or add behavior to that particular game object.
  - For reference, you may look at other Game Engines like Unity3D for inspiration: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Components.html

1. 2D sprites: used on the various layers of the background elements as they scroll by.  
2. 3D models: used on the player characters, enemies, coins, etc.
3. UI elements: scoreboard, time remaining, etc.
4. Camera: the positionable camera used for rendering.
5. Lights: for lighting the scene.
6. Particles: for effects, such as smoke, sparkles, and debris. Probably tied to the 2D sprites and 3D models.
7. Animations: for manipulating and blending the various aforementioned components.
