# Part 0 - SDL Introduction 

# Description

For this portion of the assignment you are going to do a 'follow along exercise' to get up to speed on game programming and working with the Simple Directmedia Layer framework.

Some of these concepts you may be familiar with, some of these concepts you will be totally new to you depending on what program you are coming from. So once again, we will be going through a full course in order to get you up to speed.

## F.A.Q.

1. Question - Why do I have to sign up for this? Can't you just give us a written assignment?
    - There is an [./Archive](./Archive) of the previous version of the assignment if you prefer to read some of the details on SDL.
    - I think the video format is better -- you can also see how I fix mistakes.
    - There are not really other equivalents for SDL 3 at the time of the original creation of this assignment in Spring 2024.
2. Question: - Do I have to make Space Invaders? 
    - Yes, you can add more or less, but you should have a space invaders like program.
3. Question: - How should I follow along the videos?
    - Type as I type, experiment, try things out, and experiment.
    - Just watching the videos on 2X will not be enough to absorb material, it's important to perform *active learning* by trying the examples.
    - **IMPORTANT**: I have provided source code for most of the videos as they progress. Take the time now to follow along the videos and experiment -- if you simply copy & paste, it may become hard later on to understand how to create your own original works.
